To start the dev env,
you must have Nix installed,
with experimental features nix-command,
and flakes in your nix.conf:
"extra-experimental-features = nix-command flakes",
and then run "nix develop",
in the directory where the flake.nix is located.

WARNING: vscode is run as super-user because I couldn't make so otherwise,
so I made it run with obscure flags.
